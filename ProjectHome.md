## Introduction ##
The python-imagescanner (old pyscanning) implements an abstraction layer which allows users to scan images/documents from Linux or Windows without the need of write any specific Python code for each one of them.

Note: The devices are accessed using the available installed drivers in the platform. Currently the support for Windows is implemented with Twain API and for Linux with SANE.

## Supported Devices ##

All devices supported by SANE (Linux) and Twain (Windows).
If you are able to use your device with another application in your platform but you still to access it with imagescanner, please, fill a bug report.

Devices supported by SANE: http://www.sane-project.org/sane-backends.html
